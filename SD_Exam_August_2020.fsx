(*Question 2*)

let rec f i = function

//2.1
//2.1.1

//get to the point of trying to take out multiple element from the list

    [] -> []

fFix 10 [1..10] //val it : int list = [11; -9; 15; -9; 19; -9; 23; -9; 27; -9]

//2.1.2:

let sum xs = 
    match xs with
    |[] -> [] //if xs is empty, return an empty list
    |[x] -> [] //if there's one element in the list, return an empty list
    |_  -> let rec inner xs xs' i = //else, make a recuresive inner function

//The result above is as expected, as the list sonists of some negative integers, and thus e.g. (-9)+19=10

//2.2

(*2.2.1:
g and f are not tail recursive, as the call to x1+i occours outside the function call, thus being stored seperately in the stack
*)

(*Question 3*)
type name = string;;

and Children = Single of name
             | Couple of FamilyTree;;

let fam1 = Family ("Hanne", "Peter", [])
let fam2 = Family ("Kurt", "Pia", [Single "Henrik"]);;


//3.1
(*3.1.1:
The type of fam1 is a FamilyTree. This can be deduced, as we declare that fam1 contains a Family of name,name, children list, which is exactly what a 
FamilyTree consits of
*)

//3.1.2:

let fam3 = Family("Charlotte", "Oliver", [Couple fam1; Couple fam2]);; //Family consisting of charlotte and oliver, with a list of kids, their status, and their family
                                                                       //tree

//3.2

//3.2.1
let rec numPerFam (ft:FamilyTree) = function
    |Family(_,_,[]) -> 2 //if the family has no children, return 2
    |Family(_,_,ch) ->  match ch with //if they do have children
                            |[l] -> 2 + (numPerChildren l) //if they only have one kid, add 2 to numPerChildren of that element
                            |xs   -> 2 + (List.map(fun f -> numPerChildren f) xs) //else, apply numPerChildren to all the kids, and plus that together with 2              

and numPerChildren (ch:Children) = 
    match ch with
    |Single x -> 1 //if the child is single, add one
    |Couple x -> 2 + (numPerFam x);; //else, add 2.

//NOTE numPerFam doesn't work, neither does numPer children. However, I can't get it to work probably, but I believe I'm close to a working answer


//3.2.2:

let rec toListFam (ft:FamilyTree) =


and toListChildren (ch:Children) = 
    match ch with
    |Single x -> 






//3.3

//No, as single's can only contain a string, and nothing else. Thus, there is no way to associate the person with a new familiy tree, where
//Children could exist.

(*Question 4*)

//4.1

//4.1.1


let rec F n =
    match n with
    |0 -> 1
    |n when n>0 -> n-M(F(n-1))//if n is greater than 0, do n-M(F(n-1))

List.map M [0..10];; //[0; 0; 1; 2; 2; 3; 4; 4; 5; 6; 6]


//4.1.2:
let  combineFM n = ((F n), (M n)) //call F n and M n, and combine to at tuple

combineFM 4 //val it : int * int = (3, 2)

//4.2

//4.2.1:

let Fseq = Seq.initInfinite(fun i -> F i);; //Initiate an infinite function, where i is the integer in the sequence, and then appply F on that i

Seq.item 5 Fseq //val it : int = 3

//4.2.2:

let FseqCache = Seq.cache(Fseq);; //Use the higher order function Se.cache, to make a cached version of Fseq

Seq.item 5 FseqCache //val it : int = 3

(*The two functions has the same type, as they do the exact same thing. The only difference is, that the Fseq would be called immidiatel when executed, while
    FSeqCache is only executed when we actually use it (i.e. it is cached*)

let combineFMSeq = seq{for i in 0..1000 do yield combineFM i};; //create a sequence, in this case with 1001 elements
                                                                //it was unclear what the size had to be, so I made the decision to make it size 10001.
                                                                //Then yield the tuple returned from combineFM on i

Seq.take 4 combineFMSeq //val it : seq<int * int> = seq [(1, 0); (1, 0); (2, 1); (2, 2)]
